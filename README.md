## Description
Welcome to my monorepo showing all of my Frontend Mentor submissions. I decided instead of creating a new repository for each challenge I would consolidate all my challenges into a single monorepo powered by [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs).

### What is Frontend Mentor?
Frontend Mentor is a platform that provides challenges that mimic real-world web development projects. It features challenges from simple projects like landing pages and components all the way to CRUD applications.


## This is a monorepo.
As briefly explained above, I didn't want to pollute my GitHub with countless Frontend Mentor submissions so I decided to further challenge myself by housing all my submissions in a monorepo powered by Turborepo. I've so far had only positive experiences with this approach and can recommend this for anybody looking to build up a directory of their challenge submissions.

## Installation
If for whatever reason you wish to install the application locally, here are the instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`
